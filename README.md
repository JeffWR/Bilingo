"Small Children Learning to Speak" is an interactive web-art project exploring the cultural repression of the "I." Using a familiar language-learning UI, users translate difficult emotions across Eastern and Western contexts. Re-experience the linguistic environment of your upbringing to reflect on how criticism shapes your self-expression.
